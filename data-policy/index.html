                <p>Effective date: December 28, 2020<br><br>Evolves ("us", "we", or "our") operates the
                    https://evolves.agency // https://blog.evolves.agency // https://evolves.cloud //
                    https://evolves.work website (the "Service").<br><br>This page informs you of our policies regarding
                    the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you
                    have associated with that data.<br><br>We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using
                    the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
                    Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same
                    meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from https://evolves.agency.</p>
                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a
                    particularly high priority for the management of the Evolves. The use of the Internet pages of the
                    Evolves is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants to use
                    special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If
                    the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
                    generally obtain consent from the data subject.</p>
                <p>The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a
                    data subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in
                    accordance with the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the Evolves. By means
                    of this data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the
                    nature, scope, and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data
                    subjects are informed, by means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are
                    entitled.</p>
                <p>As the controller, the Evolves has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures to
                    ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
                    Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may
                    not be guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via
                    alternative means, e.g. by telephone.</p>
                <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
                <p>The data protection declaration of the Evolves is based on the terms used by the European legislator
                    for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our data protection declaration
                    should be legible and understandable for the general public, as well as our customers and business
                    partners. To ensure this, we would like to first explain the terminology used.</p>
                <p>In this data protection declaration, we use, inter alia, the following terms:</p>
                <ul style="list-style:none">
                    <h2>a)    Personal data</h2>
                    <p>Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person

                        indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification
                        number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical,
                        physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                    </p>
                    <h2>b) Data subject</h2>
                    <p>Data subject is any identified or identifiable natural person, whose personal data is processed
                        by the controller responsible for the processing.</p>

                        of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording,
                        organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
                        disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or

                    <h2>d)    Restriction of processing</h2>
                    <p>Restriction of processing is the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their
                        processing in the future.</p>
                    <h2>e)    Profiling</h2>
                    <p>Profiling means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of
                        personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular
                        to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person's performance at work, economic
                        situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or
                        movements.</p>
                    <h2>f)     Pseudonymisation</h2>
                    <p>Pseudonymisation is the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can
                        no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information,
                        provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and
                        organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or
                        identifiable natural person.</p>
                    <h2>g)    Controller or controller responsible for the processing</h2>

                        authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
                        means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are
                        determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its
                        nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
                    <h2>h)    Processor</h2>

                        personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>
                    <h2>i)      Recipient</h2>
                    <p>Recipient is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the
                        personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may
                        receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or
                        Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those
                        public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to
                        the purposes of the processing.</p>
                    <h2>j)      Third party</h2>
                    <p>Third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data
                        subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or
                        processor, are authorised to process personal data.</p>
                    <h2>k)    Consent</h2>
                    <p>Consent of the data subject is any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of
                        the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action,
                        signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>

                    taken over by the website, and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another
                    example is the cookie of a shopping cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles
                    that a customer has placed in the virtual shopping cart via a cookie.</p>
                <p>The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
                    corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of
                    cookies. Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or
                    other software programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject
                    deactivates the setting of cookies in the Internet browser used, not all functions of our website
                    may be entirely usable.</p>
                <h2>4. Collection of general data and information</h2>
                <p>The website of the Evolves collects a series of general data and information when a data subject or
                    automated system calls up the website. This general data and information are stored in the server
                    log files. Collected may be (1) the browser types and versions used, (2) the operating system used
                    by the accessing system, (3) the website from which an accessing system reaches our website
                    (so-called referrers), (4) the sub-websites, (5) the date and time of access to the Internet site,
                    (6) an Internet protocol address (IP address), (7) the Internet service provider of the accessing
                    system, and (8) any other similar data and information that may be used in the event of attacks on
                    our information technology systems.</p>
                <p>When using these general data and information, the Evolves does not draw any conclusions about the
                    data subject. Rather, this information is needed to (1) deliver the content of our website
                    correctly, (2) optimize the content of our website as well as its advertisement, (3) ensure the
                    long-term viability of our information technology systems and website technology, and (4) provide
                    law enforcement authorities with the information necessary for criminal prosecution in case of a
                    cyber-attack. Therefore, the Evolves analyzes anonymously collected data and information
                    statistically, with the aim of increasing the data protection and data security of our enterprise,
                    and to ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process. The anonymous data of
                    the server log files are stored separately from all personal data provided by a data subject.</p>
                <h2>5. Contact possibility via the website</h2>
                <p>The website of the Evolves contains information that enables a quick electronic contact to our
                    enterprise, as well as direct communication with us, which also includes a general address of the
                    so-called electronic mail (e-mail address). If a data subject contacts the controller by e-mail or
                    via a contact form, the personal data transmitted by the data subject are automatically stored. Such
                    personal data transmitted on a voluntary basis by a data subject to the data controller are stored
                    for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject. There is no transfer of this personal
                    data to third parties.</p>
                <h2>6. Comments function in the blog on the website</h2>
                <p>The Evolves offers users the possibility to leave individual comments on individual blog
                    contributions on a blog, which is on the website of the controller. A blog is a web-based,
                    publicly-accessible portal, through which one or more people called bloggers or web-bloggers may
                    post articles or write down thoughts in so-called blogposts. Blogposts may usually be commented by
                    third parties.</p>
                <p>If a data subject leaves a comment on the blog published on this website, the comments made by the
                    data subject are also stored and published, as well as information on the date of the commentary and
                    on the user's (pseudonym) chosen by the data subject. In addition, the IP address assigned by the
                    Internet service provider (ISP) to the data subject is also logged. This storage of the IP address
                    takes place for security reasons, and in case the data subject violates the rights of third parties,
                    or posts illegal content through a given comment. The storage of these personal data is, therefore,
                    in the own interest of the data controller, so that he can exculpate in the event of an
                    infringement. This collected personal data will not be passed to third parties, unless such a
                    transfer is required by law or serves the aim of the defense of the data controller.</p>
                <h2>7. Subscription to comments in the blog on the website</h2>
                <p>The comments made in the blog of the Evolves may be subscribed to by third parties. In particular,
                    there is the possibility that a commenter subscribes to the comments following his comments on a
                    particular blog post.</p>
                <p>If a data subject decides to subscribe to the option, the controller will send an automatic
                    confirmation e-mail to check the double opt-in procedure as to whether the owner of the specified
                    e-mail address decided in favor of this option. The option to subscribe to comments may be
                    terminated at any time.</p>
                <h2>8. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data</h2>
                <p>The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period
                    necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator
                    or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.</p>
                <p>If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European
                    legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or
                    erased in accordance with legal requirements.</p>
                <h2>9. Rights of the data subject</h2>
                <ul style="list-style:none">
                    <h2>a) Right of confirmation</h2>

                            22(1) and (4) of the GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the
                            logic involved, as well as the significance and envisaged consequences of such processing
                            for the data subject.</li>

                    <p>Furthermore, the data subject shall have a right to obtain information as to whether personal
                        data are transferred to a third country or to an international organisation. Where this is the
                        case, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards
                        relating to the transfer.</p>
                    <p>If a data subject wishes to avail himself of this right of access, he or she may, at any time,

                        controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning him or
                        her. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right
                        to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary
                        statement.</p>
                    <p>If a data subject wishes to exercise this right to rectification, he or she may, at any time,

                    <h2>d) Right to erasure (Right to be forgotten)</h2>
                    <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator to obtain from the
                        controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay, and the
                        controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the
                        following grounds applies, as long as the processing is not necessary:</p>

                        <li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but

                        Article 6(1) of the GDPR, and the processing is carried out by automated means, as long as the
                        processing is not necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or

                        concerning him or her, which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) of the GDPR. This also
                        applies to profiling based on these provisions.</p>
                    <p>The Evolves shall no longer process the personal data in the event of the objection, unless we
                        can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests,

                        claims.</p>
                    <p>If the Evolves processes personal data for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have
                        the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such
                        marketing. This applies to profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
                        If the data subject objects to the Evolves to the processing for direct marketing purposes, the
                        Evolves will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
                    <p>In addition, the data subject has the right, on grounds relating to his or her particular
                        situation, to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her by the Evolves for
                        scientific or historical research purposes, or for statistical purposes pursuant to Article
                        89(1) of the GDPR, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out
                        for reasons of public interest.</p>
                    <p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject may contact any employee of the

                        services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, to use his or her right to object by
                        automated means using technical specifications.</p>
                    <h2>h) Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h2>
                    <p>Each data subject shall have the right granted by the European legislator not to be subject to a
                        decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects
                        concerning him or her, or similarly significantly affects him or her, as long as the decision
                        (1) is not is necessary for entering into, or the performance of, a contract between the data
                        subject and a data controller, or (2) is not authorised by Union or Member State law to which

                <h2>10. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Facebook</h2>
                <p>On this website, the controller has integrated components of the enterprise Facebook. Facebook is a
                    social network.</p>
                <p>A social network is a place for social meetings on the Internet, an online community, which usually
                    allows users to communicate with each other and interact in a virtual space. A social network may
                    serve as a platform for the exchange of opinions and experiences, or enable the Internet community
                    to provide personal or business-related information. Facebook allows social network users to include
                    the creation of private profiles, upload photos, and network through friend requests.</p>
                <p>The operating company of Facebook is Facebook, Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, United
                    States. If a person lives outside of the United States or Canada, the controller is the Facebook
                    Ireland Ltd., 4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland.</p>
                <p>With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet website, which is operated by the
                    controller and into which a Facebook component (Facebook plug-ins) was integrated, the web browser
                    on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically prompted to download
                    display of the corresponding Facebook component from Facebook through the Facebook component. An
                    overview of all the Facebook Plug-ins may be accessed under
                    https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. During the course of this technical procedure,
                    Facebook is made aware of what specific sub-site of our website was visited by the data subject.</p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook, Facebook detects with every call-up to
                    our website by the data subject—and for the entire duration of their stay on our Internet site—which
                    specific sub-site of our Internet page was visited by the data subject. This information is
                    collected through the Facebook component and associated with the respective Facebook account of the
                    data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Facebook buttons integrated into our website,
                    e.g. the "Like" button, or if the data subject submits a comment, then Facebook matches this
                    information with the personal Facebook user account of the data subject and stores the personal
                    data.</p>
                <p>Facebook always receives, through the Facebook component, information about a visit to our website by
                    the data subject, whenever the data subject is logged in at the same time on Facebook during the
                    time of the call-up to our website. This occurs regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the
                    Facebook component or not. If such a transmission of information to Facebook is not desirable for
                    the data subject, then he or she may prevent this by logging off from their Facebook account before
                    a call-up to our website is made.</p>
                <p>The data protection guideline published by Facebook, which is available at
                    https://facebook.com/about/privacy/, provides information about the collection, processing and use
                    of personal data by Facebook. In addition, it is explained there what setting options Facebook
                    offers to protect the privacy of the data subject. In addition, different configuration options are
                    made available to allow the elimination of data transmission to Facebook. These applications may be
                    used by the data subject to eliminate a data transmission to Facebook.</p>
                <h2>11. Data protection provisions about the application and use of Google Analytics (with anonymization
                    function)</h2>
                <p>On this website, the controller has integrated the component of Google Analytics (with the anonymizer
                    function). Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analytics is the collection, gathering,
                    and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to websites. A web analysis service collects,
                    inter alia, data about the website from which a person has come (the so-called referrer), which
                    sub-pages were visited, or how often and for what duration a sub-page was viewed. Web analytics are
                    mainly used for the optimization of a website and in order to carry out a cost-benefit analysis of
                    Internet advertising.</p>
                <p>The operator of the Google Analytics component is Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow
                    Street, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Ireland.</p>
                <p>For the web analytics through Google Analytics the controller uses the application "_gat.
                    _anonymizeIp". By means of this application the IP address of the Internet connection of the data
                    subject is abridged by Google and anonymised when accessing our websites from a Member State of the
                    European Union or another Contracting State to the Agreement on the European Economic Area.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the Google Analytics component is to analyze the traffic on our website. Google uses
                    the collected data and information, inter alia, to evaluate the use of our website and to provide
                    online reports, which show the activities on our websites, and to provide other services concerning
                    the use of our Internet site for us.</p>
                <p>Google Analytics places a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. The
                    definition of cookies is explained above. With the setting of the cookie, Google is enabled to
                    analyze the use of our website. With each call-up to one of the individual pages of this Internet
                    site, which is operated by the controller and into which a Google Analytics component was
                    integrated, the Internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject will
                    automatically submit data through the Google Analytics component for the purpose of online
                    advertising and the settlement of commissions to Google. During the course of this technical
                    procedure, the enterprise Google gains knowledge of personal information, such as the IP address of
                    the data subject, which serves Google, inter alia, to understand the origin of visitors and clicks,
                    and subsequently create commission settlements.</p>
                <p>The cookie is used to store personal information, such as the access time, the location from which
                    the access was made, and the frequency of visits of our website by the data subject. With each visit
                    to our Internet site, such personal data, including the IP address of the Internet access used by
                    the data subject, will be transmitted to Google in the United States of America. These personal data
                    are stored by Google in the United States of America. Google may pass these personal data collected
                    through the technical procedure to third parties.</p>
                <p>The data subject may, as stated above, prevent the setting of cookies through our website at any time
                    by means of a corresponding adjustment of the web browser used and thus permanently deny the setting
                    of cookies. Such an adjustment to the Internet browser used would also prevent Google Analytics from
                    setting a cookie on the information technology system of the data subject. In addition, cookies
                    already in use by Google Analytics may be deleted at any time via a web browser or other software
                    programs.</p>
                <p>In addition, the data subject has the possibility of objecting to a collection of data that are
                    generated by Google Analytics, which is related to the use of this website, as well as the
                    processing of this data by Google and the chance to preclude any such. For this purpose, the data
                    subject must download a browser add-on under the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout and
                    install it. This browser add-on tells Google Analytics through a JavaScript, that any data and
                    information about the visits of Internet pages may not be transmitted to Google Analytics. The
                    installation of the browser add-ons is considered an objection by Google. If the information
                    technology system of the data subject is later deleted, formatted, or newly installed, then the data
                    subject must reinstall the browser add-ons to disable Google Analytics. If the browser add-on was
                    uninstalled by the data subject or any other person who is attributable to their sphere of
                    competence, or is disabled, it is possible to execute the reinstallation or reactivation of the
                    browser add-ons.</p>

                    of a display of the corresponding Instagram component of Instagram. During the course of this
                    technical procedure, Instagram becomes aware of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by
                    the data subject.</p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged in at the same time on Instagram, Instagram detects with every call-up

                    is collected through the Instagram component and is associated with the respective Instagram account
                    of the data subject. If the data subject clicks on one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our
                    website, then Instagram matches this information with the personal Instagram user account of the
                    data subject and stores the personal data.</p>
                <p>Instagram receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our
                    website provided that the data subject is logged in at Instagram at the time of the call to our
                    website. This occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on the Instagram button or not. If such

                    under https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en/. During the course of this technical procedure, YouTube
                    and Google gain knowledge of what specific sub-page of our website was visited by the data subject.
                </p>
                <p>If the data subject is logged in on YouTube, YouTube recognizes with each call-up to a sub-page that
                    contains a YouTube video, which specific sub-page of our Internet site was visited by the data
                    subject. This information is collected by YouTube and Google and assigned to the respective YouTube
                    account of the data subject.</p>
                <p>YouTube and Google will receive information through the YouTube component that the data subject has
                    visited our website, if the data subject at the time of the call to our website is logged in on
                    YouTube; this occurs regardless of whether the person clicks on a YouTube video or not. If such a
                    transmission of this information to YouTube and Google is not desirable for the data subject, the
                    delivery may be prevented if the data subject logs off from their own YouTube account before a
                    call-up to our website is made.</p>
                <p>YouTube's data protection provisions, available at https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/,
                    provide information about the collection, processing and use of personal data by YouTube and Google.
                </p>
                <h2>16. Legal basis for the processing</h2>
                <p>Art. 6(1) lit. a GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent
                    for a specific processing purpose. If the processing of personal data is necessary for the
                    performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when
                    processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service, the
                    processing is based on Article 6(1) lit. b GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations
                    which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries
                    concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which
                    processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the
                    processing is based on Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR. In rare cases, the processing of personal data may be
                    necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person. This
                    would be the case, for example, if a visitor were injured in our company and his name, age, health
                    insurance data or other vital information would have to be passed on to a doctor, hospital or other
                    third party. Then the processing would be based on Art. 6(1) lit. d GDPR. Finally, processing
                    operations could be based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR. This legal basis is used for processing
                    operations which are not covered by any of the abovementioned legal grounds, if processing is
                    necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our company or by a third party,
                    except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of
                    the data subject which require protection of personal data. Such processing operations are
                    particularly permissible because they have been specifically mentioned by the European legislator.
                    He considered that a legitimate interest could be assumed if the data subject is a client of the
                    controller (Recital 47 Sentence 2 GDPR).</p>
                <h2>17. The legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party</h2>
                <p>Where the processing of personal data is based on Article 6(1) lit. f GDPR our legitimate interest is
                    to carry out our business in favor of the well-being of all our employees and the shareholders.</p>
                <h2>18. Period for which the personal data will be stored</h2>
                <p>The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal data is the respective statutory
                    retention period. After expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely deleted, as
                    long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of the contract or the initiation of a
                    contract.</p>
                <h2>19. Provision of personal data as statutory or contractual requirement; Requirement necessary to
                    enter into a contract; Obligation of the data subject to provide the personal data; possible
                    consequences of failure to provide such data</h2>
                <p>We clarify that the provision of personal data is partly required by law (e.g. tax regulations) or
                    can also result from contractual provisions (e.g. information on the contractual partner). Sometimes
                    it may be necessary to conclude a contract that the data subject provides us with personal data,
                    which must subsequently be processed by us. The data subject is, for example, obliged to provide us
                    with personal data when our company signs a contract with him or her. The non-provision of the
                    personal data would have the consequence that the contract with the data subject could not be
                    concluded. Before personal data is provided by the data subject, the data subject must contact any
                    employee. The employee clarifies to the data subject whether the provision of the personal data is
                    required by law or contract or is necessary for the conclusion of the contract, whether there is an
                    obligation to provide the personal data and the consequences of non-provision of the personal data.
                </p>
